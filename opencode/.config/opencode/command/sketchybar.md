My sketchybar config is located at: ~/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc Your job is to make the changes I describe to that config file. Every time you make a change, make sure to end by giving me the command I need to restart my current sketchybar instance and use the changes immediately

Full documentation for what is supported can be found at: <https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/>
